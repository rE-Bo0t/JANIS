# JANIS
Currently JANIS supports Windows OP, but in the future it may will support Android and IOS. JANIS is provided with a simple interface, for now you can type your requests, and JANIS will answer with voice. In the not so far future, JANIS will have the ability to hear, a thig that will make the UI & UX much better.
